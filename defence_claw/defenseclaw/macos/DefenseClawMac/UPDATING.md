# Updating the imported macOS app

Use this procedure to refresh `macos/DefenseClawMac` from the standalone [`keitheobrien/defenseclaw_mac`](https://github.com/keitheobrien/defenseclaw_mac) repository without losing the monorepo's release, identity, or licensing integration.

## 1. Prepare the update

Start from an updated `main` and create a feature branch. Confirm the current pin and online freshness state:

```bash
python3 scripts/check-macos-upstream.py --offline
python3 scripts/check-macos-upstream.py
```

Prepare the latest stable update with:

```bash
scripts/update-macos-app.sh
```

Pass an explicit stable release tag to reproduce or select an update:

```bash
scripts/update-macos-app.sh v1.2.0
```

The updater performs a three-way merge using the commit in [upstream.lock.toml](upstream.lock.toml) as the base, the checked-in Cisco app as `ours`, and the requested stable upstream release as `theirs`. This preserves Cisco integration while surfacing real conflicts for review. It updates the lock and this provenance record, reapplies license headers, and runs the macOS checks. If a conflict occurs, the script leaves the merge under `build/macos-upstream-sync-<tag>` and does not modify the checked-in app.

Review upstream changes since the old locked SHA before accepting the generated diff.

Only sync these maintained paths:

```text
DefenseClawMac.xcodeproj/
DefenseClawMac/
Tests/
script/build_and_run.sh
script/test_connector_onboarding.sh
tools/
images/
.gitignore
```

Do not import upstream Git metadata, `.codex`, personal signing identities, a duplicate `LICENSE`, or design/planning documents that the monorepo supersedes. Port relevant changes from the standalone DMG script into `scripts/build-macos-app-release.sh`; do not restore its hard-coded team, keychain profile, or download-from-an-already-published-release assumptions.

## 2. Preserve Cisco integration points

After syncing, review and restore these intentional differences:

- Bundle identifier: `com.cisco.defenseclaw.macos`.
- No personal Apple development team or signing identity in the project file.
- App `MARKETING_VERSION` matches the repository `VERSION`.
- `UpdateChecker` reads releases from `cisco-ai-defense/defenseclaw`, selects only verified `DefenseClawMac-*-macos-arm64.zip` assets, and never offers `-unverified` artifacts through in-app self-update.
- Before extraction, `UpdateChecker` rejects empty or malformed ZIP manifests, absolute and traversal paths, link entries, multiple app bundles, and content outside one top-level `.app` bundle.
- `RuntimeInstaller` continues to understand `Contents/Resources/RuntimePayload`.
- Release packaging remains in `scripts/build-macos-app-release.sh` and `.github/workflows/release.yaml`, producing a runtime-bearing DMG and app-only self-update zip.

Search for stale personal/repository settings:

```bash
rg -n 'keitheobrien|9R236BB67S|com\.keitheobrien|Developer ID Application' macos/DefenseClawMac
```

Any retained upstream attribution belongs in [UPSTREAM.md](UPSTREAM.md), not in runtime identifiers.

## 3. Apply and verify license headers

The updater changes [UPSTREAM.md](UPSTREAM.md) and [upstream.lock.toml](upstream.lock.toml) together. Confirm the stable tag resolves to the recorded immutable commit, then run:

```bash
python3 scripts/macos_license_headers.py --fix
python3 scripts/macos_license_headers.py
```

The fixer adds the full Cisco Apache-2.0 header to commentable imported files. PNG assets and asset-catalog `Contents.json` manifests are covered by [ASSET_LICENSES.md](ASSET_LICENSES.md). The check fails on any new file type until its licensing policy is made explicit.

## 4. Build and test

Run from the repository root:

```bash
make check-version-sync
make macos-app-test
make extensions
make dist-cli
make macos-app-release
make macos-app-release-verify
```

Mount the resulting DMG and confirm it contains `DefenseClawMac.app`, an `/Applications` symlink, the matching gateway and wheel under `Contents/Resources/RuntimePayload`, and `payload-manifest.json`. Confirm the zip contains the app without `RuntimePayload`, preserving the independent runtime update track. Local development builds may produce clearly named `-unverified` artifacts, but the in-app self-updater ignores those assets.

Confirm the app-only ZIP contains exactly one top-level `.app` bundle and no absolute paths, `..` components, symlinks, hardlinks, or unrelated top-level files. The updater performs this validation before `ditto` extraction, then requires bundle identity/version checks, code-signature validation, and Gatekeeper assessment before installation.

The first-run runtime installer pins its fallback `uv` download by version and SHA-256 in `RuntimeInstaller.swift`. When updating that pin, use an immutable `astral-sh/uv` release, copy the Apple Silicon archive digest from the release asset, and verify the archive locally before changing both constants together.

All five release-environment secrets
(`MACOS_DEVELOPER_ID_P12_BASE64`, `MACOS_DEVELOPER_ID_P12_PASSWORD`,
`MACOS_NOTARY_KEY_BASE64`, `MACOS_NOTARY_KEY_ID`, and
`MACOS_NOTARY_ISSUER_ID`) produce verified macOS app-update assets. Production
and local builds may omit all five and produce ad-hoc-signed `-unverified`
assets for manual download and installation; the in-app self-updater rejects
them. Partial credentials, or any invalid configured credential, stop the
workflow before publication.

## 5. Review before merging

- Inspect the complete upstream diff, especially process execution, update URLs, token handling, filesystem writes, and embedded payload installation.
- Confirm no credentials, signing certificates, developer-team IDs, generated build products, or local user paths were imported.
- Confirm every GitHub Action is pinned to an immutable commit SHA.
- Confirm the release job downloads both the DMG and zip before regenerating `checksums.txt` and publishing the atomic GitHub release.
- Confirm `test_update_checker_verification.sh` and `test_update_checker_safety.sh` pass, covering verified-only asset selection and pre-extraction archive rejection.
- Confirm `python3 scripts/check-macos-upstream.py` succeeds online. Release
  preflight validates the lock offline; the scheduled freshness workflow owns
  detection of a newer upstream release.
- Confirm the scheduled `macOS Upstream Freshness` workflow is enabled. It opens one update issue when the latest stable standalone release advances.
- Record exact commands and observed results in the pull request test plan.
