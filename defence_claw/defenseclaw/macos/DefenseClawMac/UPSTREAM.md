# Upstream provenance

The macOS app was imported from [`keitheobrien/defenseclaw_mac`](https://github.com/keitheobrien/defenseclaw_mac) at:

- Stable release: `v1.1.5`
- Commit: `c3b7681b082eefb8d8e21dc9347270b7bf803b0e`
- Commit title: `Release DefenseClawMac 1.1.5`
- Imported: 2026-07-10

The import includes the Xcode project, Swift sources, tests, developer build/test scripts, icon-generation tool, asset catalog, and README images. It intentionally excludes the upstream repository's Git metadata, `.codex` configuration, personal signing identities, duplicate license file, and standalone release wrapper. The upstream `scripts/build_unified_dmg.sh` behavior is adapted into the monorepo's `scripts/build-macos-app-release.sh` so the unified DMG is built from the same unpublished commit as the backend release rather than downloading an already-published runtime.

Cisco integration changes after import include the Cisco bundle identifier, unified release source, synchronized DefenseClaw version, ad-hoc-by-default signing, the runtime-bearing DMG plus app-only update zip, monorepo CI/release workflows, and Cisco Apache-2.0 headers.

The same immutable release and commit are recorded in
[upstream.lock.toml](upstream.lock.toml). The weekly freshness workflow reports
a newer stable release. Release preflight validates the checked-in lock
offline; it deliberately does not query the upstream repository or prove that
the pin is the latest release.

Update this file and the lock whenever the imported app is refreshed. Follow [UPDATING.md](UPDATING.md); do not copy the standalone repository wholesale.
