"""defenseclaw quickstart — zero-prompt first-run setup.

Designed for ``make all`` and ``install.sh --quickstart``. Picks safe
defaults (observe profile, local scanner, no judge) and runs every step
of the install flow without asking the user a single question. Power
users who want something different should use ``defenseclaw init`` or
``defenseclaw setup guardrail`` instead.
