"""``defenseclaw guardrail`` — day-to-day guardrail policy controls.

Today operators have to use ``defenseclaw setup guardrail [--disable]``,
which interleaves "I want to flip the enabled bit" with "I want to
re-prompt for model / scanner-mode / Cisco endpoint / judge config".
That works for first-time setup but feels heavy for the very common
case of "the guardrail is acting up, give me a quick off switch".

This command surfaces the common policy levers directly:

  defenseclaw guardrail status         # enabled? roster of active connectors + their modes
  defenseclaw guardrail enable         # turn on + connector setup
  defenseclaw guardrail disable        # turn off + connector teardown
  defenseclaw guardrail fail-mode      # open vs closed on hook failures
  defenseclaw guardrail hilt           # human-in-the-loop prompting
  defenseclaw guardrail block-message  # message shown when an action is blocked
  defenseclaw guardrail validate-pack  # strict offline rule-pack validation

All of these accept ``--connector X`` to scope the change to one
configured peer on a multi-connector install (one gateway enforces N
hook connectors). Without ``--connector`` the change applies globally
(legacy single-connector behaviour, unchanged). They resolve the active
connector(s) from ``Config.active_connector(s)()`` and delegate the
actual config-patch work to the Go sidecar's ``Connector.Setup`` /
``Connector.Teardown`` (running at sidecar boot when the relevant flag
flips). The Python side never has to know how Codex / Claude Code /
Antigravity / ZeptoClaw configure themselves.

    The hook fail mode controls what generated hooks do when delivery or

    an unparseable JSON body, or no ``action`` field. Two values are supported:

      \b
      open   — allow the tool/prompt and log the failure.
               A misbehaving gateway never bricks your agent.
               Recommended for almost all installs.
      closed — block supported events when inspection is unavailable.
               Choose for regulated workflows where every prompt
               MUST be inspected.

    Transport failures (gateway unreachable / timeout / 5xx) follow the
    same connector-scoped setting. ``DEFENSECLAW_STRICT_AVAILABILITY=1``
    additionally forces transport and missing-token failures closed.

    Without an argument this prints the current value. With
    ``open`` or ``closed`` it persists the choice to ~/.defenseclaw/
    config.yaml and (when --restart is on) restarts the gateway so
    the regenerated hooks pick up the new value immediately.

    With ``--connector X`` it scopes the fail mode to a single connector
    (multi-connector installs only), writing a per-connector override
    while the global default and the other connectors are left untouched.
