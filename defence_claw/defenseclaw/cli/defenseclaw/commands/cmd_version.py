"""``defenseclaw version`` — cross-component version inspector.

Where ``defenseclaw --version`` only speaks for the Python CLI, this
command surfaces the version of *every* DefenseClaw component the
operator has on their machine (CLI, gateway binary, OpenClaw plugin)
and warns when they drift.

Drift matters because the three components ship together: the gateway
speaks a sidecar REST API the CLI depends on, and the plugin's IPC
contract with the gateway changes from release to release. Running
mismatched builds is the single most common cause of silent
"guardrail not enforcing" reports in the field — so we make drift
explicit instead of waiting for it to manifest as a runtime error.

Exit codes:
    0 — all components in sync (or operator explicitly opted in with
        ``--json`` and is making the decision themselves)
    1 — drift detected. The summary table still prints on stdout so
        CI can diff it without parsing stderr.
