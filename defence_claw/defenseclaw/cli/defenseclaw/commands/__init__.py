    * An explicit ``--connector X`` narrows to exactly that one validated
      peer.
    * With no flag the listing covers **every active connector**.
      ``Config.active_connectors()`` returns a single name on a
      single-connector install and N names on a fan-out install, so the

      cleanly instead of fanning out to a phantom ``openclaw``. That keeps
