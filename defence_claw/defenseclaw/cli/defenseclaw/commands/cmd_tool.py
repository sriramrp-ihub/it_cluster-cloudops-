"""defenseclaw tool — Manage tool-level block/allow lists.

Tools are named functions exposed by skills, MCP servers, or connectors.

Scoping is one of two ORTHOGONAL, mutually exclusive encodings:

* ``--connector C`` → ``@C/<tool>``  — the runtime-enforceable scope for a
  configured connector. Both gateway lanes (hook + sidecar) resolve
  connector-scoped rows then fall back to the bare unscoped row.
* ``--source S``    → ``S/<tool>``   — audit/fallback only. The runtime payload
  carries no source, so a ``block --source`` fail-closes to an unscoped block and
  an ``allow --source`` row is recorded for visibility but never enforced.

Bare rows apply to every configured connector as the fallback tier. Bare
block/allow/unblock also clear connector-specific install overrides for the
same tool so an older ``@connector/tool`` row cannot silently defeat the
all-connectors intent.

Bare:       defenseclaw tool block delete_file
Connector: defenseclaw tool block delete_file --connector hermes
Source:    defenseclaw tool block delete_file --source filesystem
