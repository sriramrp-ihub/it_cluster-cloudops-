# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# `defenseclaw setup llm`
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# First-class CLI entry point for (re)configuring the unified top-level
# ``llm:`` block. Before this subcommand existed, operators had three
# partial paths to the same config:
#
#   * ``scripts/setup-llm.sh`` — shell script invoked by ``make all``,
#     but invisible from ``defenseclaw --help``.
#   * ``defenseclaw setup skill-scanner`` / ``mcp-scanner`` — prompt for
#     LLM settings as a side effect, but scoped to that scanner.
#   * Hand-editing ``~/.defenseclaw/.env`` + ``config.yaml``.
#
# Exposing ``_configure_llm`` as ``defenseclaw setup llm`` gives the
# unified configurator a stable, discoverable surface. It's a thin
# wrapper — the prompt logic lives in ``_configure_llm`` so the init
# wizard and this command stay in lockstep.

    Routes all LLM traffic through the built-in Go guardrail proxy.
    Every prompt and response is inspected for prompt injection, secrets,
    PII, and data exfiltration patterns.

    Use --connector (alias: --agent) to select the agent framework
    connector. The connector
    determines how LLM traffic is intercepted, how tool calls are
    inspected, and what subprocess enforcement policy is applied. When
    omitted, the value defaults to the install-time hint at
    ``<data_dir>/picked_connector`` (written by ``scripts/install.sh
    --connector ...``), then to any previously saved choice in
    ``guardrail.connector``, then to ``openclaw``.

    Two modes:
      observe — log findings, never block (default, recommended to start)
      action  — block prompts/responses that match security policies

    Use --disable to turn off the guardrail and restore direct LLM access.

# setup <hook connector>  —  observe-by-default aliases
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# These are thin wrappers around the hook-driven setup branch. They
# exist because operators who only want telemetry (no traffic
# interception, no enforcement) currently have to walk through the full
# ``setup guardrail`` wizard, answer "yes" to a single confirm, and
# trust that the wizard does the right thing under the hood. The
# aliases shortcut that by defaulting to observe mode while still
# accepting ``--mode action`` for hook-native blocking:
#
#   defenseclaw setup codex          → observe by default for Codex
#   defenseclaw setup claude-code    → observe by default for Claude Code
#   defenseclaw setup hermes         → observe by default for Hermes
#   defenseclaw setup cursor         → observe by default for Cursor
#   defenseclaw setup windsurf       → observe by default for Windsurf
#   defenseclaw setup geminicli      → observe by default for Gemini CLI
#   defenseclaw setup copilot        → observe by default for GitHub Copilot CLI
#   defenseclaw setup openhands      → observe by default for OpenHands
#   defenseclaw setup antigravity    → observe by default for Antigravity (agy)
#
# Both commands also flip ``claw.mode`` so the rest of the CLI/TUI
# (skill scanner, MCP scanner, plugin scanner, overview panels) reads
# from the matching connector's source-of-truth files (``~/.codex`` or
# ``~/.claude``) instead of OpenClaw's default ``~/.openclaw`` layout.
# Without this flip, ``defenseclaw scan skills`` after ``setup codex``
# would scan ``~/.openclaw/skills`` and miss every Codex skill — a
# foot-gun we explicitly want to close.
#
# Hook connectors have no proxy data path to engage. Observe mode
# records via hooks and native OTel where documented; action mode uses
# the same hook bus to return deny verdicts on policy hits.

# Stable hint filename used by ``defenseclaw setup guardrail`` and
# ``defenseclaw quickstart`` to default the connector picker after a
# fresh install. Mirrors the ``picked_connector`` constant baked into
# scripts/install.sh — keeping these in sync means re-running the
# alias commands here updates the hint just like the installer would.

#
#   * _PROXY_BACKED_CONNECTORS — connectors whose enforcement path
#     interposes a local HTTP proxy on the LLM data path (port 4000).
#     openclaw and zeptoclaw bind the proxy listener at gateway boot
#     and route requests through Bifrost.
#
#   * _HOOK_ENFORCED_CONNECTORS — connectors whose enforcement path is
#     the agent's own hook bus (PreToolUse / UserPromptSubmit /
#     PostToolUse). The agent talks directly to its native upstream;
#     DefenseClaw observes via hooks + (where the vendor documents it)
#     native OTLP, and BLOCKS by returning a deny verdict from the
#     PreToolUse hook. ``mode=action`` IS supported on this surface —
#     it's hook-driven blocking, not proxy-driven.
#
# Action mode is supported on both surfaces; the difference is only
# the data-path topology and the proxy listener binding decision. The
# observability-only label is reserved for installs where the operator
# explicitly picks mode=observe.

    NOTE (architecture): As of the input.hilt SSOT change, the Go gateway
    now passes ``cfg.Guardrail.HILT`` directly into ``policy.GuardrailInput``
    so the Rego policy reads ``input.hilt.{enabled,min_severity}`` and
    ``config.yaml`` is the single source of truth for the gateway path.
    See ``internal/gateway/guardrail.go`` (``SetHILTConfig`` / ``hiltInput``)
    and ``policies/rego/guardrail.rego`` (``_hilt := input.hilt if {...}
    else := object.get(data.guardrail, "hilt", {})``).

    This helper is now a **fallback** that keeps non-gateway callers
    (direct ``opa eval`` invocations, integration tests that build a
    ``GuardrailInput`` without HILT, third-party tooling) consistent with
    the wizard's view of HILT. The gateway no longer DEPENDS on it for
    correctness, but mirroring the value here costs nothing and avoids
    confusing operators who introspect ``data.json`` directly.

    The HILT toggle has two consumers:

    1. The Go inspector reads ``cfg.Guardrail.HILT`` from ``config.yaml``
       and injects it into the Rego ``input`` (the gateway path — primary).
    2. The Rego ``defenseclaw.guardrail`` policy falls back to
       ``data.guardrail.hilt`` from ``policies/rego/data.json`` when the
       caller does not populate ``input.hilt`` (legacy / test path).

    Operator-facing wizards (``defenseclaw init``, ``defenseclaw setup
    guardrail``) persist (1) via ``config.yaml`` and mirror to (2) via
    this helper as defense-in-depth. The helper is intentionally narrow:
    it ONLY mirrors the ``guardrail.hilt`` block, leaving thresholds,
    patterns, severity_mappings, etc. owned by ``defenseclaw policy
    activate`` (which calls ``_sync_opa_data`` in ``cmd_policy``). That
    keeps the wizard from accidentally clobbering activated-policy state.

    ``defenseclaw setup splunk`` and still see ``telemetry — disabled in

    Skip conditions:
      * ``app.cfg`` isn't loaded (e.g. ``setup --help``, or a recovery

      * config.yaml mtime unchanged — the subcommand was read-only
        (``setup llm --show``, etc.). The bare connector batch is the narrow
        exception: its explicit readiness marker always runs the gate.
      * Gateway PID file shows the process is not running — generic setup does
        not auto-start a sidecar an operator deliberately stopped. A bare
