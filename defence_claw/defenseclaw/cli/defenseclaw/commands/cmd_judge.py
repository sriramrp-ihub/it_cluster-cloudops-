"""``defenseclaw guardrail judge`` — LLM-judge configuration helpers.

The judge runs in two lanes with different control models:

* **Proxy lane** (openclaw / zeptoclaw): the judge runs automatically
  whenever ``guardrail.judge.enabled`` is true. There is no per-connector
  gate — nothing to add or remove.
* **Hook lane** (hermes, opencode, claudecode, …): gated per connector by
  ``guardrail.judge.hook_connectors``, **default off**. The gate ships
  empty deliberately — the judge adds latency (up to
  ``guardrail.judge.hook_timeout``, default 5s) and LLM cost per inspected
  hook call, so upgrades must not silently change behavior. The cost of
  that safety default is that every operator must perform an explicit
  opt-in, and before this command the only way to do that was hand-editing
  ``config.yaml`` and manually restarting the gateway.

``defenseclaw guardrail judge`` is that missing authoring surface:

  defenseclaw guardrail judge add hermes      # opt one connector in
  defenseclaw guardrail judge add all         # every hook connector
  defenseclaw guardrail judge remove opencode
  defenseclaw guardrail judge list            # gate + effective state

The group lives under ``guardrail`` (not ``setup``) because it is a
day-to-day policy lever, like ``guardrail hilt`` and ``guardrail
fail-mode`` — ``setup`` stays reserved for wizards and one-time
authoring. The flat ``add``/``remove``/``list`` shape gates only the
hook lane; proxy connectors are rejected with an explanation (their
lane is always judged when the judge is enabled), so the scoping lives
in validation rather than the command name.

Like ``cmd_guardrail`` (which registers this group), this module never
imports ``cmd_setup`` at module load — the heavy click tree isn't
needed for ``judge list``. Helpers lazily import it inside the command
bodies; tests patch ``cmd_setup._restart_services`` as usual.
