"""Persistent migration cursor for ``defenseclaw upgrade``.

Decouples "which migration version we shipped with this build" (the
package's ``__version__``) from "which migrations have actually run on
this host" (the cursor file). Without this split we hit four bug
classes documented in the per-function docstrings:

* author forgets to bump ``__version__`` -> migrations re-fire forever
* migration partially fails -> cursor unchanged -> retried automatically
* operator restores from backup -> ``__version__`` perception drifts but
  the cursor on disk is the truth
* operator skips the upgrade flow entirely -> any code path that calls
  ``run_migrations`` with the cursor stays consistent

Schema-evolution contract:

* The on-disk schema is versioned by ``CURRENT_SCHEMA_VERSION``.
* A cursor written by a newer DefenseClaw build than the one currently
  installed must be treated as opaque: read what we can, never silently
  rewrite fields we don't understand. ``load`` returns ``None`` for
  unknown schemas to force the operator into ``defenseclaw doctor
  migration-state --reset`` rather than letting us downgrade their
  state silently.
* Durable atomic writes: every save uses a same-directory staging file plus
  a write-through native replacement so a crash leaves the previous good
  copy or the fully persisted new cursor.
* Mode 0o600: the file logs upgrade timestamps. Not strictly secret,
  but tightening permissions matches the rest of ``~/.defenseclaw/``
  and stops accidental world-readable installs.

This module is intentionally framework-free: it has no Click, no
``ux``, no logger, no config dependency. ``run_migrations`` and
``defenseclaw doctor`` are the only callers; they own the user-facing
output. Keeping this module pure lets tests construct cursors without
spinning up an ``AppContext``.
