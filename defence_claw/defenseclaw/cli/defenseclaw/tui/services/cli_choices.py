"""Shared CLI choice lists for the Textual TUI wizards.

Each tuple here mirrors a list defined in the CLI command modules.
Centralizing them in one place removes the drift that previously
caused the skill/MCP scanner wizards to lag behind ``_configure_llm``'s
provider catalogue. The TUI and the cmd_* modules are still distinct
import roots; ``test_cli_choices_module_matches_cli_source_of_truth``
in ``cli/tests/tui/test_setup_panel.py`` asserts exact parity between
the constants here and ``cmd_setup._WIZARD_LLM_PROVIDERS`` /
``cmd_agent._AI_DISCOVERY_MODES`` so drift fails CI.

If you add a value to a CLI choice, mirror it here in the same pull
request. Treating these as build-time constants keeps the wizards
snappy (no Click group imports during TUI startup) without giving up
the parity guarantee.
