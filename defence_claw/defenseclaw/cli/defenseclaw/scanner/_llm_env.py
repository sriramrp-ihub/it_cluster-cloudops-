"""Shared LLM environment injector for Python scanners.

DefenseClaw exposes a single canonical LLM key via
``DEFENSECLAW_LLM_KEY`` (see :mod:`defenseclaw.config.LLMConfig`). The
Python scanners (skill, MCP, plugin) all use LiteLLM under the hood,
and LiteLLM expects provider-specific env vars (``OPENAI_API_KEY``,
``ANTHROPIC_API_KEY``, etc.) to be set. This helper derives the right
env var from the resolved ``LLMConfig.provider_prefix()`` and writes it
into ``os.environ`` before the scanner boots LiteLLM.

Keeping this mapping in one place avoids the provider drift we saw
when each scanner maintained its own two-entry dict — historically
``mcp.py`` had a hard-coded ``{openai, anthropic}`` base-URL table
and ``skill.py`` had a matching ``llm_provider`` allowlist, both of
which silently disabled the LLM analyzer for every other provider.
Those wrapper-side tables have been removed; this single map is now
the only place a provider needs to be added so the unified
``DEFENSECLAW_LLM_KEY`` flows into the right LiteLLM env var.

The full provider list is kept in lockstep with:

* ``internal/gateway/bifrost_provider.go`` — Bifrost's routing table
* ``internal/configs/providers.json``       — OpenClaw fetch interceptor

Add new providers here first, then propagate to those two files in the
same PR. Local providers (ollama/vllm/lm_studio) deliberately have no
entry: they don't take an API key — only ``base_url`` — and the
scanner flips to that mode in :func:`inject_llm_env` below.
