"""Curated registry of every audit-event `action` string emitted by
DefenseClaw.

Mirrors ``internal/audit/actions.go`` 1:1. The Go file is the source
of truth; Python parity is enforced by ``scripts/check_audit_actions.py``.

Rules
-----
* NEVER use a raw string literal at an audit log call site. Import
  the constant below.
* Adding a new action is a minor schema bump: append here, extend
  Go, regenerate the schema (``make check-schemas``), run
  ``make check-audit-actions``.
* Removing or renaming a constant is a breaking change: bump
  ``defenseclaw.version.SchemaVersion`` and announce to downstream.
