"""Cross-platform PID liveness checks for the gateway daemon lifecycle.

The gateway is a detached background daemon whose PID is recorded in
``<data_dir>/gateway.pid``. The CLI reads that file to decide whether
``defenseclaw setup --restart`` should ``restart`` the running daemon or
``start`` a fresh one.

POSIX can probe liveness with ``os.kill(pid, 0)``: signal 0 sends nothing,
it only checks that the PID exists and is signalable. On Windows that idiom
is wrong — CPython maps signal 0 to ``CTRL_C_EVENT`` and routes it through
``GenerateConsoleCtrlEvent``, which fails for a daemon in a separate process
group and raises ``OSError``. The naive check therefore reports a live
gateway as dead, so ``setup --restart`` silently downgrades to a no-op
``start`` against the already-bound port. The daemon never reboots into the
guardrail-enabled config, its connector ``Setup`` never runs, the hook
``.token`` is never written, and every native Windows hook then fails open
with "missing gateway token".

On Windows we instead open a real process handle
(``OpenProcess(PROCESS_QUERY_LIMITED_INFORMATION)``) and confirm the process
has not already exited, mirroring the Go daemon's ``processExists`` in
``internal/daemon/proc_windows.go`` so both sides agree on what "running"
means.
