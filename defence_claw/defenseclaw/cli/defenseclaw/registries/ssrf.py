"""URL safety guards for registry adapters.

Registry sources are operator-provided URLs that DefenseClaw will fetch
on the operator's behalf — exactly the pattern that earns a finding in
:mod:`policies.guardrail` and the codebase rules. We refuse to fetch
anything that resolves to localhost, link-local, multicast, or
RFC1918/ULA private addresses by default. Operators that genuinely
need to ingest from a private host must opt in with ``--allow-private``;
the flag is plumbed all the way through the CLI surface so an
"oops, my URL was internal" mistake stays explicit.

DNS resolution is dependency-injected so the guard can be unit-tested
without network access. :func:`guard_url` uses
:func:`socket.getaddrinfo` by default, but tests can pass a custom
``resolver`` callback.
