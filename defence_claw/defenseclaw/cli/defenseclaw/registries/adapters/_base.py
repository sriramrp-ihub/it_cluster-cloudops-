"""Shared HTTP helpers for registry adapters.

We deliberately keep this layer paper-thin so the security-relevant
guards stay visible and uniform across every adapter:

* :func:`http_get` performs an SSRF check against the URL, rejects
  redirects to disallowed hosts, caps the response body at
  :data:`MAX_MANIFEST_BYTES`, and applies a fixed timeout.
* :func:`auth_header` reads the auth token from the env var named on
  the source (never the literal token), strips whitespace, and refuses
  to pass through control characters.

All adapters call :func:`http_get` rather than :mod:`requests` directly
so a single point of audit covers the whole ingest path.
