"""Headless bootstrap helpers.

These are the idempotent, non-interactive pieces of ``defenseclaw init``:
directory creation, policy seeding, audit DB initialization, and gateway
default resolution. Factoring them out of ``cmd_init`` lets non-init flows
(``quickstart``, tests, migrations) rerun the setup without re-printing the
banner or prompting the user.

Design rule: *no click.echo in here*. Callers (``cmd_init``, ``quickstart``)
are responsible for rendering any UI. That keeps this module easy to test
and safe to call from background contexts.

      auto-generates on first boot, so the Python and Go halves now
