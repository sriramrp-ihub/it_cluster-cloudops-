"""Shared admission evaluation helpers for Python CLI paths.

These helpers intentionally mirror the admission ordering used by the Go
gateway/watcher:

1. Explicit block list entries override everything.
2. Asset policy can block denied/unregistered/default-denied assets.
3. Explicit allow list entries skip scan/enforcement after asset policy.
4. Policy-managed allow entries (for example first-party bundles) may bypass
   scan depending on the active policy data.
5. If no scan result exists yet, the active policy decides whether scanning is
   required.
6. Once a scan result exists, the effective per-target action mapping decides
   whether the result is rejected or only warned.
