"""Per-OS connector support — the Python single source of truth.

Windows support is not a boolean derived from connector topology.  A native
agent/runtime and a DefenseClaw integration that can be wired without WSL are
both required. The resulting status is one of ``supported``, ``preview``,
``not_certified``, or ``unsupported`` and always carries a reason.

DefenseClaw runs hook-only on Windows: agents invoke the native Go hook
entrypoint (``defenseclaw-gateway hook``) directly, and there is no Windows
guardrail-proxy lifecycle. The proxy/chat connectors (``openclaw`` and
``zeptoclaw``) therefore cannot run on Windows, so the TUI/CLI must not offer
or accept them there.

This module mirrors ``internal/gateway/connector/platform_support.go``.  Tests
pin the two taxonomies and all Python presentation lists together.  macOS and
Linux retain their historical behavior: every built-in and plugin connector is
offered there.
