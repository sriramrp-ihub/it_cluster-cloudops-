"""Webhook notifier package.

Parity layer for the runtime ``webhooks[]`` list consumed by
``internal/gateway/webhook.go``. Provides:

* ``writer`` — YAML CRUD (atomic tmp+rename) alongside the canonical v8
  observability destination writer.
* ``dispatch`` — pure-Python formatters for slack/pagerduty/webex/generic
  payloads plus a ``send_synthetic`` helper used by
  ``defenseclaw setup webhook test``.

The Go runtime stays the source of truth for dispatch; the Python
formatters share compact-JSON and HMAC semantics with the Go code and
are covered by structural-parity tests in both ``cli/tests`` and
``internal/gateway`` so drift is caught in CI.
