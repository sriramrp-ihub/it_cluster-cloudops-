"""CI gate: every ``DEFENSECLAW_*`` callsite in the codebase MUST be
declared in ``internal/envvars/registry.json``.

This test bakes a repo-wide audit into CI so any new env-var reference
added to the codebase fails the build unless the contributor also
adds a registry entry.

How it works
------------
1. Walk the repository starting at the repo root.
2. Skip vendored dirs (``node_modules``, ``vendor``, ``.venv``,
   build outputs, dotfile dirs, etc.).
3. For every source file (Go / Python / TypeScript / shell / YAML /
   Dockerfile / extensionless shebang script / docs), regex-extract every token matching
   ``DEFENSECLAW_[A-Z0-9_]+``.
4. Build the union of all extracted names.
5. Compare to ``set(registry.names())``.
   * Names referenced in the code but not in the registry → fail.
   * Names declared in the registry but never referenced anywhere →
     warn (printed as informational; does not fail). Some entries are
     deliberately documentation-only (e.g. test placeholders).

False-positive handling
-----------------------
Code that talks ABOUT env vars (registry.json itself, env-vars.mdx,
env-vars.mdx, this very test, the doctor check, the doc generator, the
registry modules) is allow-listed via path. Comments referencing env
vars in other source files are *not* allow-listed — they're considered
real references and contribute to the union.
