"""Mutual-exclusion contract for ``locked_config_yaml``.

This runs on every OS in CI. On Windows it exercises the ``msvcrt.locking``
path; on POSIX it exercises ``fcntl.flock``. It is the regression guard for
the bug where the Windows lock grabbed a different byte offset on each
acquisition (append-mode write + post-write file position) and therefore let
concurrent holders into the critical section simultaneously.
