"""Regression tests for the upgrade-integrity and LLM key-reuse remediations.

Each test corresponds to a confirmed finding and asserts the *secure*
(fail-closed) behavior plus the explicit ``--allow-unverified`` opt-out where
one exists for legacy releases.  DefenseClaw 0.8.4+ provenance is mandatory
and cannot be bypassed.

Findings covered:

* F-0201 / F-0703 — abort the upgrade when no integrity metadata is available.
* F-0202        — refuse an unsigned/unverifiable checksum manifest.
* F-0704        — warn and continue with checksum validation when cosign is
                  missing but signed checksum assets are present.
* F-0203        — fail closed when the release upgrade manifest cannot be
                  fetched.
* F-0701        — never send the gateway bearer token to a non-loopback probe
                  host.
* F-0061        — never reuse the resolved default api_key with a caller-chosen
                  endpoint.
