"""Unit tests for the Step 9 command-palette upgrade.

Covers the pure logic — risk badge derivation, MRU-aware ordering
for empty queries, and needs-arg hinting — without spinning up a
Textual event loop. The async ``test_app_shell`` suite still owns
the end-to-end keyboard/mouse coverage of the drawer.
