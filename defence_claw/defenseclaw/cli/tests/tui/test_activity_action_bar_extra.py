"""Extra regressions for the Activity action bar (Phase 1a code-review gaps).

The core tests live in ``test_app_shell.py`` next to their siblings,
but ``test_app_shell.py`` is the highest-churn test file in the TUI
suite — placing these in their own module keeps them out of merge /
overwrite collisions when other agents land changes touching the
broader shell tests.

Covers gaps the initial Phase 1a test set missed:

* Cancel button visible (and enabled) when a command is actually
  running — the inverse of ``test_activity_panel_exposes_clickable_action_bar``
  which only proves it's hidden when idle.
* View in Drawer button routes to ``action_open_command`` — without
  this test the button could silently fail to fire the palette.
* Stdin submission gracefully handles broken-pipe / executor errors —
  the TUI must never crash because a subprocess just exited mid-write.
