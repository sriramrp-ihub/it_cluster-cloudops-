"""Click-first action bars for the visible catalog panels (Skills / MCPs /
Plugins).

These tests cover the new control bars that mirror the keyboard flow:
each catalog panel exposes a ``<panel>-controls`` ``Horizontal`` with a
``<panel>-filter`` ``Input`` plus a row of action buttons whose ids
follow ``<panel>-<suffix>``. The buttons route through the shared
``_handle_catalog_control`` dispatcher, which translates the click into
a ``CatalogListModel.handle_key`` call so the click and keystroke
paths produce the same intent (preview gating, Activity streaming,
audit records etc. are all shared with the keyboard flow).

These tests intentionally live outside ``test_app_shell.py`` — that
file is the highest-churn test surface in the TUI suite, so isolating
new coverage here avoids merge collisions with other agents touching
the broader shell tests.
