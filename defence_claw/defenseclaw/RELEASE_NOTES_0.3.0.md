## Highlights

- **Externalized rule packs, detection strategies, and full policy TUI** — RFC #111 lands the new pluggable policy surface.
- **Observability v7** — structured gateway events, OTel GenAI semconv spans/metrics, audit sinks, TUI verdicts, and a five-surface fan-out local stack.
- **Hardened enforcement** — centralized admission policy and closed security gaps, including credential-leakage fixes on `/health` and `/status`.
- **Bundled DefenseClaw Splunk in Free mode** for an out-of-the-box trial experience.
- **Provider expansion**, webhook notifications, and an OpenShell standalone sandbox.
