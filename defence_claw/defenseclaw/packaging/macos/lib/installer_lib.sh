# DefenseClaw macOS installer — pure-function helpers.
#
# This library contains the side-effect-free pieces of install.sh so they
# can be unit-tested without touching /Library, sudo, or the LaunchDaemon.
# install.sh sources this file. tests/ also sources it.
#
# Functions in this file MUST NOT:
#   - call sudo, chown, chmod, install(8), launchctl
#   - write outside paths the caller passed in
#   - depend on globals other than what the caller exports
#
# They DO:
#   - parse strings, render YAML, run pure file I/O against caller-owned
#     paths (e.g. a tmpdir under /tmp/dctest-XXXX).

# ---- connector list parsing --------------------------------------------

# parse_connectors LIST -> echoes one normalized connector per line.
# Splits on comma, trims whitespace, lowercases. Empty entries are an
# error (caller's job to die() on non-zero return).

#
# Called by install.sh when render_targets_manifest produced zero rows
# despite a non-empty user set (AIFW-31486). Distinguishes the two
# operationally-different zero-target modes so an operator reading
# install.log can act on the right cause:
#
#   all-unsupported  Every requested connector is outside the auto-wire
#                    allow-list (amp|codex|claudecode|cursor). The
#                    hook-enumerator's tick will NOT fix this by itself
#                    — the operator has to rerun with --connector picking
#                    a supported entry.
#
#   none-installed   At least one requested connector IS supported, but
#                    no eligible user has any of them installed yet.
#                    This is the AIFW-31486 default customer case:
#                    the enumerator's 5-min tick picks it up
#                    automatically as connectors appear.
#
# Discovery-error separation: this helper only classifies "how did we
# end up with zero rows"; it does not classify "was metadata corrupt".
# When DC_DISCOVERY_ERRORS_LOG has entries after render_targets_manifest
# runs, install.sh treats that log as a fatal condition BEFORE reaching
# classify_zero_target_reason — an operator whose codex install has a
# corrupt package.json needs to hear "your metadata is unreadable at
# /path/to/package.json", not "we couldn't find any connector installed".
# See _record_discovery_error / _probe_json_version for the plumbing
# that feeds that log.

#               parse; the operator can act on this directly.

# On rc 2 (malformed): output is dropped, an error is recorded, and
# this helper still returns rc 0 so the outer probe loop can continue
# to the next fallback (e.g. Caskroom after npm). If EVERY probe for
# a connector on a given user's home is malformed and none yields a
# valid version, the recorded errors are what install.sh's zero-target

# runtime dependency on install-time paths" rip-out (see the
# `_read_json_field` doc block below for the QA rationale). BSD does
# not ship `timeout(1)` so the timeout is implemented by

#   2  — file exists but its top-level JSON structure is malformed (not an
#        object, unbalanced braces, invalid escape, truncated mid-value,
#        trailing garbage). Distinguishes "not installed" (empty stdout, rc 0)
#        from "installed but metadata corrupt" (empty stdout, rc 2) so
#        discover_agent_version can propagate a real discovery-error status
#        instead of silently classifying corrupt metadata as an absent
#        connector — see the DC_DISCOVERY_ERRORS_LOG plumbing in

# pre-Cisco-path install) aside under BACKUP_ROOT so an idempotent
# managed reinstall can proceed without silent data loss. Emits one
# `[install] ...` log line describing the action taken.
#
# Behavior:
#   - PATH missing / not a symlink target -> no-op, exit 0.
#   - PATH is a real file/dir/symlink -> renamed to
#     BACKUP_ROOT/<basename>.pre-<VERSION>-<TIMESTAMP>.
#   - --dry-run (may appear anywhere in the argv tail) -> logs the
#     intended action without touching disk. Used by tests and by
#     verbose install-log preview modes.
#
# Idempotent by design: two consecutive calls against the same
# already-relocated path both succeed (the second is a no-op).
#
# Kept in the pure-function library so tests can drive it under a
