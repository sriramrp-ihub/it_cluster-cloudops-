# DefenseClaw macOS uninstaller.
#
# Removes (current managed layout):
#   - LaunchDaemon (com.cisco.secureclient.defenseclaw)
#   - /opt/cisco/secureclient/defenseclaw/  (binary + config + runtime)
#   - /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cisco.secureclient.defenseclaw.plist
#
# Also sweeps legacy DefenseClaw locations from pre-managed-layout installs:
#   - LaunchDaemon (com.defenseclaw.gateway)
#   - /Library/DefenseClaw/                        (binary)
#   - /Library/Application Support/DefenseClaw/    (config + runtime)
#   - /Library/Logs/DefenseClaw/                   (logs)
#   - /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.defenseclaw.gateway.plist
# so 'sudo ./uninstall.sh --purge' cleanly cuts over a pre-move install.
#
# By default, system runtime state is PRESERVED so reinstall keeps audit
# history. Pass --purge to wipe everything (system + per-user hook footprint).
#
# Per-user cleanup (with --purge):
#   - ~/.defenseclaw/                (DefenseClaw-owned hook scripts/tokens)
#   - DefenseClaw entries scrubbed from each native agent hook config:
#       ~/.codex/config.toml         (strip [hooks], [otel], notify=)
#       ~/.claude/settings.json      (strip DC entries from hooks map)
#       ~/.cursor/hooks.json         (strip DC entries from hooks map)
#       ~/.config/amp/plugins/defenseclaw.ts
#                                    (restore/remove only when the structured
#                                     backup identity + post hash still match)
#     Non-DefenseClaw user entries in those files are preserved verbatim.
#     Pass --keep-agent-configs to skip the scrub.

# ---- agent-config scrub (BEFORE we delete ~/.defenseclaw) --------------
#
# We scrub the user's native agent hook configs first so the agent doesn't
# start hitting "command not found" + fail-close every tool call the moment
# we delete ~/.defenseclaw/hooks/*-hook.sh. The scrub runs as the target
# user (drop privileges via sudo -u) so file ownership is preserved.
#
# The scrub logic is baked into the DefenseClaw binary as
# `defenseclaw enterprise hooks scrub`; the previous Python helper
# crashed on stock macOS hosts where /usr/bin/python3 is a Xcode CLT
# stub that fails to launch without developer tools installed. Using
# our own Go binary sidesteps that dependency entirely.

# Discover the gateway binary. Managed installs land it at a known
# absolute path; bundle-fixture / dev-tree tests can override via
# DEFENSECLAW_SCRUB_BIN so they don't need the managed layout present.
#
# _scrub_bin_trusted PATH LABEL [--allow-non-root-owner]
#   Validates a candidate scrub-binary path. Returns 0 on success,
#   printing the path to stdout; returns 1 on any check failure,
#   emitting a WARN so the operator sees which check tripped. All
#   check failures write to stderr and never abort the shell — the
#   caller decides whether to fall through to the next candidate.
#
#   uninstall.sh runs under `sudo`, so the referenced binary is
#   executed as root; every candidate is treated as untrusted input
#   and must satisfy the checks below before it takes effect:
#
#     1. absolute path (relative could be rerooted by PWD)
#     2. exists as a regular file (not a directory, not a device,
#        not a symlink — a symlink swap is the exact race that
#        motivates this)
#     3. is executable
#     4. mode & 0022 == 0 (no group/other write bits — a compromised
#        umask cannot slip a writable binary through)
#     5. owned by uid 0 (matches the installer's "root-owned trusted
#        input" pattern for --plist)
#
#   `--allow-non-root-owner` skips check (5). The bundle-fixture /
#   dev-tree candidates under SCRIPT_DIR inherit the extracting
#   user's uid — that's expected for a `tar xzf` extraction and
#   matches the installer's two-tier PLIST_SRC policy where the
#   bundle default is accepted regardless of owner (its content came
#   from the trusted tarball). Managed-install candidates under
#   INSTALL_PREFIX must always be root-owned; the flag isn't used
#   there.
#
#   DC_UNINSTALL_SKIP_SCRUB_BIN_TRUST=1 is a test-side seam that
#   skips checks 4 & 5 entirely so bundle-fixture tests can drive
#   uninstall.sh against a non-root-owned binary in a tmpdir
#   (parallel to DC_INSTALLER_SKIP_ROOT_CHECK on the install side).
