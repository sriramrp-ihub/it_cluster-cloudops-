# Phase 6 observability invariants. Run after an e2e scenario has
# driven real traffic through the sidecar. This script is the
# single source of truth for both CI (.github/workflows/e2e.yml)
# and local "make e2e" runs, so do not duplicate the assertions
# anywhere else — extend them here.
#
# The script asserts:
#   1. The explicitly configured v8 JSONL destination exists and is non-empty.
#   2. Every line is a canonical v8 record with record/bucket/signal identity,
#      correlation, provenance, and field-class metadata.
#   3. Timestamps parse as RFC3339Nano and fall within a bounded
#      window (default: last 30 minutes + 5 seconds of forward drift).
#   4. request_id, when emitted, is a valid v4 UUID.
#   5. audit.db contains at least one row with a non-empty request_id.
#   6. When judge persistence is enabled, judge_bodies.db contains at least
#      one judge_responses row; the source DB remains a cutover-only fallback.
#
# The Splunk HEC mock assertion is opt-in: the CI workflow passes
# --splunk-mock-log only when judge traffic is expected (full-live
# with guardrail enabled).
#
# Usage:
#   test/e2e/observability_assertions.sh \
#       [--jsonl PATH] [--db PATH] [--judge-bodies-db PATH] \
#       [--ts-window-seconds N] [--require-judge] \
#       [--require-shared-request-id]
