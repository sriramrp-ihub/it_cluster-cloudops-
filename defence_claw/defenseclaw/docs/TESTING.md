# Testing

DefenseClaw has Python, Go, TypeScript, Rego, docs, and end-to-end test surfaces. Use the smallest focused target while developing, then run the broader gates before opening a PR.

## Common Targets

| Command | Scope |
|---------|-------|
| `make test` | Python CLI unit tests plus focused Go gateway/test packages |
| `make cli-test` | Python `pytest` suite under `cli/tests/` |
| `make cli-test-cov` | Python pytest coverage report |
| `make gateway-test` | Race-enabled Go tests for gateway and `test/` |
| `make security-suite-test` | Deterministic security + PII coverage suite (regex + stubbed judge); see [SECURITY-TEST-SUITE.md](SECURITY-TEST-SUITE.md) |
| `make security-suite-eval` | Live LLM-judge scoring of the security + PII corpus (needs `DEFENSECLAW_LLM_KEY`) |
| `make go-test-cov` | Race-enabled Go coverage across all packages |
| `make ts-test` | OpenClaw plugin Vitest suite |
| `make rego-test` | OPA tests for `policies/rego/` |
| `make check` | v7 parity, observability-v8, dashboard, provider, model-catalog, and upgrade-manifest gates |
| `make lint` | Ruff, Go formatting/linting, and Python compile check |
| `make upgrade-smoke` | Build an unsigned schema-2 candidate and prove an old controller refuses it before mutation |
| `make upgrade-smoke-matrix` | Run that unsigned-candidate refusal contract across all supported historical baselines |
| `make upgrade-developer-activation` | In a throwaway `HOME`, directly activate an unsigned exact-SHA candidate and prove target migration/runtime health without claiming resolver provenance |
| `make upgrade-signed-protocol-matrix` | Run the full resolver success/refusal policy against an already signed candidate (release gate only) |

## Focused Tests

```bash
# One Python test module
make test-file FILE=test_cmd_plugin

# One Go package or test
go test ./internal/gateway -run TestProviderCoverageCorpus -count=1

# One TypeScript plugin test
cd extensions/defenseclaw
npx --prefer-offline --no-install vitest run src/__tests__/provider-coverage.test.ts

# Rego policy tests
opa test policies/rego/ -v
```

## End-to-End Tests

E2E orchestration lives in `.github/workflows/e2e.yml`,
`scripts/test-e2e-full-stack.sh`, and `test/e2e/`. Its runner and profile
contract is documented in [E2E.md](E2E.md).

Run E2E tests only when the required local services, credentials, and platform assumptions are available.

## Release Upgrade Smoke

Schema-2 releases deliberately cannot be installed from an unsigned working-tree
candidate. A generic PR job cannot mint the
`release.yaml@refs/heads/main` Fulcio identity, and the test harness must not
replace that identity or fake a successful `cosign` check. The ordinary local
smoke therefore installs authenticated historical releases in a temporary
`HOME` and verifies both explicit-target and latest-mode attempts:

- refuse the schema-2 candidate before service stop, backup, or mutation
- leave CLI, gateway, config, OpenClaw state, permissions, and PID state unchanged
- emit the historical controller's expected forward-compatibility failure
- ship the exact reviewed POSIX resolver and signed PowerShell refusal asset bound by the candidate checksums

The protected release workflow creates one sealed candidate from the current
`main` commit selected by the dispatch. In that same run it uses the public installer on Linux,
macOS, and Windows, upgrades the latest authenticated older release, the
exact published `0.8.6` field-recovery anchor, the published `0.8.5` and
`0.8.4` boundaries, and the newest authenticated `0.7.x`, `0.6.x`, and
`0.5.x` releases on Linux and macOS, and publishes those exact bytes only
after every smoke check passes.
There is no separate certification operation or reusable receipt.

For a target newer than `0.8.7`, the seven required POSIX lanes are explicit:

1. the latest authenticated stable release older than the target (`0.8.7` for
   a `0.8.8` target);
2. exact `0.8.6`, including its clean missing-migration-cursor field state;
3. exact `0.8.5`, the hard-cut/update-mechanism boundary;
4. exact `0.8.4`, the immutable bridge boundary;
5. the newest authenticated `0.7.x` release (`0.7.2` today);
6. the newest authenticated `0.6.x` release (`0.6.6` today); and
7. the newest authenticated `0.5.x` release (`0.5.0` today).

The resolver fails closed if any fixed anchor or family lane cannot be
authenticated; it does not silently shrink this set.

```bash
# Current platform, proving one old controller refuses the unsigned candidate.
make upgrade-smoke ARGS="--from-version 0.7.2"

# Optional developer diagnostic across the complete reviewed historical floor.
# Ordinary PR CI uses a smaller path-sensitive behavior-class selection.
make upgrade-smoke-matrix ARGS="--target-version X.Y.Z"

# Fast positive target-owned migration/health check for an unsigned local
# candidate. This never calls or weakens the production upgrade resolver.
make upgrade-developer-activation ARGS="--release-root /path/to/candidate-root --target-version 0.8.5 --from-version 0.8.4 --baseline-mode seed"

# Full positive protocol matrix. This requires the sealed, release-workflow-
# signed candidate; it must not be pointed at unsigned local artifacts.
make upgrade-signed-protocol-matrix \
  ARGS="--target-version X.Y.Z --release-dir release-candidate/dist --baseline-mode seed"

# Legacy schema-1 positive harness, retained only for old release fixtures.
make upgrade-legacy-smoke-matrix \
  ARGS="--target-version 0.8.3 --release-root /path/to/published-release-root --baseline-mode seed"
```

For a Linux host without the repo's Go toolchain, prepare candidate artifacts
on a machine that can cross-build and copy the printed release root plus the
reviewed test scripts to Linux. Run target activation and production refusal as
separate claims:

```bash
scripts/test-upgrade-release.sh --prepare-only --platform linux/arm64 --keep-workdir
scp -r /tmp/defenseclaw-upgrade-smoke.xxxxxx/candidate-release openclaw-vineeth:/tmp/
ssh openclaw-vineeth 'scripts/test-developer-target-activation.sh --release-root /tmp/candidate-release --target-version 0.8.6 --from-version 0.8.5 --baseline-mode seed'
ssh openclaw-vineeth 'scripts/test-upgrade-protocol-release.sh --release-root /tmp/candidate-release --target-version 0.8.6 --from-version 0.8.4 --baseline-mode seed --refusal-contract-only'
```

For routine candidates newer than the reviewed support list, the default matrix covers the required schema-v7 bridge plus every supported 0.4.0+ historical source: `0.8.4`, `0.8.3`, `0.8.2`, `0.8.1`, `0.8.0`, `0.7.2`, `0.7.1`, `0.6.6`, `0.6.5`, `0.6.4`, `0.6.3`, `0.6.2`, `0.6.1`, `0.6.0`, `0.5.0`, and `0.4.0`.
That reviewed floor lives in `release/upgrade-baselines.json`;
the Make target and smoke-contract tests must match it exactly. At execution
time the resolver authenticates and prepends every newer immutable stable
release older than the exact `--target-version`, and candidate assembly seals
that effective snapshot with its signed checksums and upgrade manifest.
This tests newly published sources such as config-v8 `0.8.5` without baking
unpublished assets into the reviewed floor. Legacy fixture candidates exclude
reviewed sources that are not older than the candidate and fail clearly when no
supported predecessor remains. Dynamic matrix targets require the candidate
argument because the checked-in development version is not release selection;
set `UPGRADE_SMOKE_FROM` only for an intentional developer subset. Release
`0.7.0` has no downloadable assets, and `0.2.0` predates the upgrade command,
so neither is eligible for automatic staging. Targets before `0.8.5` retain
schema-v7 checks. A hard-cut manifest (`min_upgrade_protocol >= 2`) must prove
pre-mutation refusal for incapable baselines, a verified `0.8.4` bridge handoff
for every listed older POSIX source, and full v7-to-v8 observability,
private-secret, rollback, local-bundle, SQLite, and fresh-process health checks
from the bridge.

The effective baseline resolver adds published 0.8.5 dynamically as config
version 8. The harness then seeds canonical v8 config, migration
cursor, and baseline-owned bundle state; it requires later targets to preserve
config/environment bytes, avoid replaying the one-time v8 activation, refresh
managed bundle bytes, and retain operator files. Unknown future config families
fail closed until their fixture and verifier are reviewed.

One manual release dispatch builds and seals one candidate, then runs
`scripts/test-upgrade-protocol-release.sh --success-path-only` from all seven
lanes above on Linux and macOS. This includes the exact `0.8.6`
missing-cursor recovery fixture, not merely a normal `0.8.6` install. Five
ordinary seeded sources resolve their published wheel dependency graph.
The exact `0.8.5` lane additionally runs exact public `0.8.1` through the full
bridge route. Every candidate resolver invocation excludes ambient `uv` from
`PATH`, requiring the resolver's authenticated private tool handoff to work.
The `0.8.4` boundary instead starts with deliberate dependency drift and must
prove the authenticated rollback-safe bridge refresh before the `0.8.5`
handoff. It also runs the public POSIX installer on Linux
and macOS, the public PowerShell installer through the exact native Setup on
Windows, and the macOS app packaging lifecycle. The Windows release
includes both protected runtime architectures and
`DefenseClawSetup-x64.exe` with its checksum, provenance, and SBOM. Version
`0.8.7` was the first release to publish native Setup and made no Windows
upgrade claim. Releases `0.8.7` through `0.8.10` record the outer Setup and
DefenseClaw executables as `NotSigned`; their exact bytes are authenticated by
the signed checksums and release provenance, not by Authenticode. Partial platform-signing
credentials, a failed install, a failed POSIX upgrade, or any candidate-byte
mismatch aborts before publication. Complete credentials require the signed
platform result; absent credentials require explicit unverified provenance.

### 0.8.4 bridge rollout order

Publish `0.8.4` as the latest release before cutting `0.8.5`. Confirm GitHub
reports the release immutable,
let the bridge soak, and retain evidence that the sealed `0.8.4` candidate
upgraded successfully from every version in
`release/upgrade-baselines.json` on the required native platforms. Only after
that proof is green should the hard-cut candidate be cut.
The later hard-cut baseline policy must include published `0.8.4`; do not treat
an uncut branch artifact as the bridge.

## CI Workflows

Ordinary PRs stay fast, while the release dispatch validates the final signed
candidate before publishing it. See
[Release Validation Strategy](RELEASE_VALIDATION.md) for the exact release
contract and operator command.

| Workflow | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | Fast deterministic release regressions on every PR; a five-class unsigned success/refusal matrix only for release-sensitive PRs; and an exact-SHA medium upgrade canary on every main merge, alongside the normal language/parity checks |
| `.github/workflows/telemetry-registry.yml` | Exhaustive telemetry-registry mutation, provenance, and failure-atomicity suites for telemetry-sensitive PRs, nightly, and manual dispatch |
| `.github/workflows/e2e.yml` | Self-hosted end-to-end suites and scheduled validation |
| `.github/workflows/release.yaml` | One manual build, sign, smoke, and publish pipeline for a reviewed `main` commit |
| `.github/workflows/release-candidate-smoke.yml` | Reusable exact-candidate install and POSIX upgrade smoke jobs |

Ordinary PR and main CI always run `make telemetry-check`, which compiles the
real registry and rejects stale generated runtime or Go outputs. The two
exhaustive telemetry mutation suites are excluded from the regular Python
shards and run only when their registry, compiler, renderer, schema, generated
output, test, or dependency inputs change. They also run nightly and through
manual dispatch. This keeps the common CI path fast without weakening the
exhaustive gate for changes that can affect telemetry generation.

## Before a PR

```bash
make lint
make test
make ts-test
make rego-test
make check
```

For a release-sensitive change, run `make upgrade-smoke` locally and use
`make upgrade-developer-activation` with an unsigned candidate root when the
target migration/runtime changed. Neither test claims a signed bridge handoff;
the release workflow proves the final signed install and upgrade success paths.
