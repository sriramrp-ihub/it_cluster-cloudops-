# Guardrail rule-pack engineering contract

Operator CEL authoring and engine behavior are maintained in the published
[CEL authoring guide](https://cisco-ai-defense.github.io/defenseclaw/docs/policies/cel/authoring/)
and [CEL engine reference](https://cisco-ai-defense.github.io/defenseclaw/docs/policies/cel/engine/).
Recipes, suppressions, and verification steps remain in the broader
[policies documentation](https://cisco-ai-defense.github.io/defenseclaw/docs/policies/).

## Two policy layers

DefenseClaw deliberately ships two distinct policy mechanisms:

| Layer | Repository authority | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Admission and policy domains | [`../policies/rego/`](../policies/rego/) | OPA decisions for admission, guardrail actions, firewall, audit, sandbox, and skill actions |
| Guardrail rule packs | [`../policies/guardrail/`](../policies/guardrail/) | Trusted tool-call CEL rules with bounded regex fallback, unstructured runtime rules, sensitive-tool metadata, judge prompts, and suppressions |

Activating an admission policy does not select a rule-pack directory, and
selecting `guardrail.rule_pack_dir` does not activate an admission policy. Keep
that separation explicit in code and tests.

## Implementation ownership

- Go parsing and evaluation inputs:
  [`../internal/guardrail/rulepack.go`](../internal/guardrail/rulepack.go) and
  [`../internal/guardrail/suppress.go`](../internal/guardrail/suppress.go).
- Reload-aware caching:
  [`../internal/guardrail/rulepack_cache.go`](../internal/guardrail/rulepack_cache.go).
- Effective global/per-connector lookup:
  [`../internal/config/config.go`](../internal/config/config.go) and
  [`../internal/config/application_protection.go`](../internal/config/application_protection.go).
- Python scanner overlay:
  [`../cli/defenseclaw/scanner/rulepack.py`](../cli/defenseclaw/scanner/rulepack.py).
- Bundled profile data:
  [`../policies/guardrail/default/`](../policies/guardrail/default/),
  [`../policies/guardrail/permissive/`](../policies/guardrail/permissive/), and
  [`../policies/guardrail/strict/`](../policies/guardrail/strict/).

Any format or precedence change must update both language implementations and
their focused tests.

## Trusted tool-call boundary

CEL expressions run only inside the existing authenticated tool-call
evaluation path. They do not replace OPA, scan arbitrary prompt or result
text, or expose another policy endpoint. `tool_call_only` independently limits
the rule's regex fallback to that path; omitting it preserves legacy
prompt/result regex coverage while CEL remains tool-call scoped.
Authoritative ActionFacts own the semantic decision; unsupported or ambiguous
input keeps the legacy fallback. Each migrated owner emits one canonical
finding rather than independent regex and CEL findings.

Durable ordered-chain enforcement is limited to authenticated connector hooks
with canonical connector/session correlation. The audit store persists only
bounded masks and fingerprints, never raw commands, arguments, paths, URLs, or
ActionFacts.
