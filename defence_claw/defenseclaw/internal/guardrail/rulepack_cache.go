// RulePackCache de-duplicates rule-pack loads by directory path.
//
// Background: LoadRulePack reads and parses a directory of YAML files off
// disk, which is non-trivial work. In single-connector mode the gateway
// loads exactly one rule pack once at boot, so no cache is needed. With
// multi-connector support the boot loop loads a rule pack per connector via
// GuardrailConfig.EffectiveRulePackDir(connector); when several connectors
// resolve to the SAME directory (e.g. they all use the "strict" profile) a
// naive loop would read and parse that directory once per connector. This
// cache ensures each distinct directory is loaded at most once.
//
// Lifetime / invalidation: rule packs are immutable for the process lifetime
// — the production code path loads them once at boot and never hot-reloads
// (operators restart to pick up changes). The cache therefore never
// invalidates entries; it is load-once-then-serve.
//
// Ownership: the cache is an owned struct rather than a package global so it
// carries no process-wide mutable state and each test gets an isolated
// instance. The multi-connector boot loop creates one and reuses it across
// the connectors it spins up.
//
// Concurrency: Load is safe for concurrent use. Concurrent misses for one key
// share an in-flight load, while distinct directories load in parallel.
// Failed loads are shared only by callers already waiting on that attempt and
// are never retained in the success cache.
