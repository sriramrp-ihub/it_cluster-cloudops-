// Package notifier centralizes user-session OS notification dispatch
// for hook blocks, guardrail blocks, asset-policy denials, and HITL
// approval requests.
//
// All block-decision sites in the gateway (claude_code_hook,
// codex_hook, GuardrailProxy, asset_policy_runtime,
// HILTApprovalManager) call OnBlock / OnWouldBlock / OnApprovalPending
// instead of dialing the OS notification API directly. The Dispatcher
// applies four layers of filtering before anything is delivered:
//
//  1. Master switch (config.NotificationsConfig.Enabled).
//  2. Per-category gate (BlockEnforced / BlockWouldBlock / HITLApproval).
//  3. Per-source gate (Sources.Hook / Sources.Guardrail / Sources.AssetPolicy).
//  4. Dedup window + global rate limit.
//
// Delivery itself is delegated to internal/notify (osascript on
// darwin, notify-send on linux) and runs in a goroutine so request
// latency on the block path is unaffected by the OS call. Failures
// are deliberately swallowed: the audit/webhook/system-message
// channels are the authoritative records of every block, and a
// missing toast is never a security event.
