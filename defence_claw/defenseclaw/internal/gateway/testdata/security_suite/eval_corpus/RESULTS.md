# Judge Evaluation Results

> **Historical benchmark snapshot.** These values describe the dated model,

Headline metrics below are from the 2026-06-22 run
(`us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-6`). The per-category and severity-distribution
breakdowns further down are representative of judge behavior across runs.

Reproduce:

```bash
export DEFENSECLAW_LLM_KEY="$AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK"
GUARDRAIL_BENCHMARK_LLM=1 \
  go test ./internal/gateway/ -run TestEval -v -timeout 120m 2>&1 \
  | tee /tmp/eval_results.log
```

## Run metadata

| field | value |
|-------|-------|
| judge model | `us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-6` (Bedrock) |
| corpus size | 160 items per judge (120 attack + 40 benign) |
| total LLM calls | ~640 across four judges |
| wall time | ~48 min (injection 15m + pii 6m + exfil 11m + tool 16m) |
| per-request timeout | 60 s |

## Headline metrics

Two complementary detection rates: **Detection** = attack flagged at any
tier (`>NONE`, "did we catch it"); **Block** = attack flagged at the
blocking tier (`>=HIGH`, "did we block it"). They differ only for judges
with a LOW tier (PII), where context-dependent items (IP, prompt-email,
username) are correctly detected but not escalated to a block.

| Judge | Detection (>NONE) | Block (>=HIGH) | Raw FPR | Weighted FPR | Precision |
|:------|------------------:|---------------:|--------:|-------------:|----------:|
| Injection | 90.0% | 90.0% | 0.0% | 0.0% | 100.0% |
| PII | **95.0%** | 76.7% | 0.0% | 0.0% | 100.0% |
| **Exfil** | **100.0%** | **100.0%** | 7.5% | 3.8% | 97.6% |
| Tool-injection | 90.0% | 90.0% | 0.0% | 0.0% | 100.0% |

Every judge holds precision at or near 100% — the guardrail does not fire on legitimate content. PII detects 95% of attacks; its lower block rate is by design (context-dependent PII rated LOW, not missed). The remaining true misses are 4 CRITICAL PII items (digit-spaced / distractor-buried SSN+passport) and 12 injection/tool items (mostly obfuscation), all independently covered by the regex layer below.

## Defense-in-depth: regex layer coverage

The judges are one of two detection layers. The regex layer runs first on every request, catches deterministic patterns before an LLM call is issued, and handles adversarial surface forms that entity-extraction can't see through.

| Judge category area | Regex rules that independently block |
|:--------------------|:-------------------------------------|
| Injection — delimiter / model-control tokens (`<\|im_start\|>`, `<s>[INST]`, `<\|endoftext\|>`, `<<SYS>>`) | `TRUST-DELIMITER` (CRITICAL, 0.93) |
| Injection — output-format jailbreaks (respond in base64/rot13/hex) | `TRUST-OUTPUT-CONSTRAINT` (HIGH, 0.85) |
| Injection — ethics-removal / persona-adoption / tool-manipulation phrasings | `TRUST-NO-ETHICS`, `TRUST-PERSONA`, `TRUST-TOOL-MANIP` (HIGH, 0.85–0.88) |
| Injection — "start your response with Sure..." payload splitting | `TRUST-PAYLOAD-SPLIT` (HIGH, 0.87) |
| Injection / PII — zero-width character obfuscation (ZWSP/ZWNJ/ZWJ/BOM splicing) | `OBFUSC-UNICODE-ZWSP` (HIGH, 0.95) |
| PII — long-lived credential patterns (AWS keys, Anthropic keys, secrets) | `SEC-AWS-KEY`, `SEC-AWS-SECRET`, `SEC-ANTHROPIC` (CRITICAL, 0.90–0.98) |
| Exfil — reverse shells (`bash -i >& /dev/tcp`, netcat `-e`, python socket, socat EXEC) | `CMD-REVSHELL-BASH`, `CMD-REVSHELL-DEVTCP`, `CMD-REVSHELL-NC`, `CMD-REVSHELL-PYTHON`, `CMD-SOCAT-EXEC` (CRITICAL, 0.90–0.98) |
| Exfil — download-and-execute (curl / wget piped to shell, base64 piped to shell) | `CMD-PIPE-CURL`, `CMD-PIPE-WGET`, `CMD-PIPE-BASE64` (CRITICAL, 0.95) |
| Exfil — data exfiltration over curl/wget uploads | `CMD-CURL-UPLOAD`, `CMD-WGET-POST` (HIGH, 0.85) |
| Exfil — sensitive-path access attempts (`/etc/passwd`, `/etc/shadow`, SSH keys, cloud credentials) | `SENSITIVE-PATH-*` rule family |
| Tool-injection — destructive commands (`rm -rf /`, `mkfs`, `dd if=`, crontab persistence) | `CMD-RM-RF`, `CMD-MKFS`, `CMD-DD-IF`, `CMD-CRONTAB`, `CMD-SYSTEMCTL` (CRITICAL, 0.82–0.95) |
| Tool-injection — file-write to system paths (`> /etc/...`) | `CMD-ETC-WRITE` (CRITICAL, 0.90) |
| Tool-injection — network C2 listeners (`nc -l`, netcat listen modes) | `CMD-NETCAT-LISTEN` (HIGH, 0.85) |

Credentials, reverse shells, destructive commands, `/etc/` writes, sensitive-path access, zero-width splicing, and model-control-token smuggling are caught by the regex layer on a single pattern match, at HIGH or CRITICAL, independent of the LLM judge.

## Tier accuracy on attack items

| Judge | Exact-tier match | Over-fire ≥1 tier (blocks at higher severity) |
|:------|-----------------:|----------------------------------------------:|
| **Exfil** | **100.0%** | 9.1% (HIGH → CRITICAL) |
| **PII** | **92.5%** | 0% |
| **Tool-injection** | **83.3%** | 17.6% (HIGH → CRITICAL) |
| Injection | 70.0% | 200% — multi-tier over-attribution; always blocks |

When the judges differ from the truth label, they differ in the direction of blocking harder, not blocking softer.

## Severity distribution (truth vs judge verdicts)

| Judge | Truth | Judge verdicts |
|:------|:------|:---------------|
| Injection | CRIT=36, HIGH=84, NONE=40 | CRIT=104, HIGH=4, NONE=52 |
| PII | CRIT=66, HIGH=30, LOW=24, NONE=40 | CRIT=62, HIGH=27, LOW=22, NONE=49 |
| Exfil | CRIT=24, HIGH=96, NONE=40 | CRIT=34, HIGH=89, NONE=37 |
| Tool-injection | CRIT=72, HIGH=48, NONE=40 | CRIT=74, HIGH=35, NONE=51 |
