# Judge Evaluation Corpus

This is the **broad live-judge tier** of the security + PII suite (see
[`../README.md`](../README.md) and
[`docs/SECURITY-TEST-SUITE.md`](../../../../../docs/SECURITY-TEST-SUITE.md)).
It is a labeled benchmark scored against a real model; its items also seed
the deterministic regex tier (the generated block of `../regex/corpus.jsonl`).

Labeled evaluation dataset for the four LLM-based guardrail judges:

- **Injection** — prompt-injection attacks on the user→LLM surface
- **PII** — personally identifiable information disclosure
- **Exfil** — sensitive-file access and exfiltration-channel usage
- **Tool-injection** — adversarial content in LLM-emitted tool-call arguments

Each judge has its own `corpus.jsonl` under
`{judge}/corpus.jsonl` containing 160 items (120 attack + 40 benign)
covering every category the judge detects, across multiple severity
tiers and surface-form variations.

## Recorded results

[`RESULTS.md`](RESULTS.md) is the dated scorecard for the recorded model run.
It contains the run metadata, headline metrics, per-category breakdowns, and
the complementary regex-layer coverage table. Treat it as a reproducible
snapshot, not as a timeless claim about a different model, corpus revision, or
judge implementation.

## Running the evaluation

```bash
# Requires Bedrock (or other LLM provider) credentials exported under
# DEFENSECLAW_LLM_KEY. ~45–60 minutes wall time for all four judges.
export DEFENSECLAW_LLM_KEY="$AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK"

GUARDRAIL_BENCHMARK_LLM=1 \
  go test ./internal/gateway/ -run TestEval -v -timeout 120m
```

To run a single judge:

```bash
GUARDRAIL_BENCHMARK_LLM=1 \
  go test ./internal/gateway/ -run TestEvalInjectionJudge -v -timeout 30m
```

## Corpus schema

Each line of `corpus.jsonl` is a JSON object with these fields:

| field | type | description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `id` | string | Stable identifier for the item |
| `judge` | string | Which judge this item targets (`injection`, `pii`, `exfil`, `tool_injection`) |
| `direction` | string | `prompt`, `completion`, or `tool_call` |
| `tool_name` | string | Tool name (tool-injection only) |
| `content` | string | The actual content fed to the judge |
| `is_attack` | boolean | Ground-truth label |
| `expected_categories` | array | Categories the judge should flag (empty for benigns) |
| `expected_severity` | string | Expected verdict severity tier (`NONE`, `LOW`, `MEDIUM`, `HIGH`, `CRITICAL`) |
| `expected_severity_prompt` | string | PII only — direction-aware expected severity |
| `expected_severity_completion` | string | PII only — direction-aware expected severity |

## Metrics reported by the scoring harness

- **Detection rate (>NONE)** — % of attack items the judge flagged at any tier above NONE ("did we catch it at all")
- **Block rate (>=HIGH)** — % of attack items the judge returned at severity ≥ HIGH ("did we block it"); the two differ only where a judge has a LOW tier (PII)
- **FPR (False Positive Rate)** — % of benign items where the judge returned severity ≥ HIGH
- **Weighted FPR** — same FPs weighted by predicted tier (CRITICAL FP = 4× cost of MEDIUM FP)
- **Precision / F1** — standard binary-classifier metrics
- **Tier-miss / over-fire histograms** — how far each attack's predicted severity landed from expected
- **Confusion matrix** — truth tier × predicted tier
- **Per-category recall + precision** — accuracy per attack category (e.g. `Instruction Manipulation`, `SSN`, `Sensitive File Access`)
