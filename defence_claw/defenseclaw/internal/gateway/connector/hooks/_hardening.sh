# defenseclaw-managed-hook v6
# Shell-side hook hardening helpers.
DEFENSECLAW_BAKED_HOOK_PATH=""
#
# Schema versions:
#   v2 — initial hardening helpers (rlimit, env sanitization,
#        defenseclaw_handle_missing_token, plain
#        defenseclaw_log_hook_failure CONNECTOR HOOK REASON FAIL_MODE).
#   v3 — defenseclaw_log_hook_failure grew a CATEGORY argument
#        (transport|response) that lets operators tell infra outages
#        apart from misconfiguration in hook-failures.jsonl. Hook
#        scripts in this directory (claude-code-hook.sh, codex-hook.sh,
#        inspect-*.sh) pass the new arg in slot 4; older helpers
#        misroute it into FAIL_MODE, dropping the category field. The
#        version digit is therefore load-bearing: writeHookHelpers
#        compares it against the on-disk file and refuses to downgrade
#        so an older `defenseclaw-gateway restart` can't silently
#        clobber a newer install.
#   v4 — defenseclaw_harden_env now calls
#        _defenseclaw_sweep_stale_hook_dirs at the end so the legacy
#        fallback path (DEFENSECLAW_HOME/hook-tmp.$$, used when mktemp
#        is missing) doesn't accumulate orphaned directories from
#        crashed / SIGKILLed hooks where the EXIT trap never fires.
#        The sweep is best-effort; the EXIT-trap cleanup is still the
#        primary mechanism. Behaviour is otherwise identical to v3
#        (no helper signatures changed), so a downgrade to v3 only
#        loses the stale-dir sweep — older hook scripts that source
#        either version keep working unmodified.
#   v6 — adds the _dc_jq shim: real jq when available (unchanged on
#        Mac/Linux), python3 fallback for object + string fields, then a
#        pure-shell string-only last resort.  This makes block decisions
#        parse-able on hosts without jq.  No helper signatures changed;
#        hook scripts just replace bare `jq` calls with `_dc_jq`.
#        NOTE: an earlier iteration of v6 also restored curl/jq directories
#        from the pre-lockdown PATH after hardening. That was removed because
#        the pre-lockdown PATH is agent-controlled and restoring one of its
#        directories could re-admit an agent-planted binary. Windows no
#        longer uses these bash hooks (it runs the hook natively in the Go
#        binary), so the Git Bash /mingw64 workaround is no longer needed.
#   v5 — adds defenseclaw_read_stdin_capped, a bounded replacement for
#        the historical PAYLOAD=$(cat) idiom. The unbounded read pulled
#        the entire agent payload into a shell variable BEFORE the
#        gateway's MaxBytesReader could trim it; a 100MB hostile body
#        could OOM the agent process. v5 caps the read at
#        ${DEFENSECLAW_HOOK_MAX_BODY:-1048576} bytes (1MB by default,
#        well above the largest legitimate prompt) using `head -c` and
#        emits a transport-category log line + fail-closed error when
#        the cap is exceeded so we don't silently truncate JSON.
#   v6 — adds W3C trace context forwarding helpers. Hooks can now
#        propagate an existing trace into the gateway via traceparent /
#        tracestate headers so a single span in the operator's APM
#        connects "agent saw tool call" → "gateway evaluated hook" →
#        "scanner emitted finding" → "audit row persisted". The two
#        new helpers:
#          - defenseclaw_extract_trace_context: parses
#            DEFENSECLAW_TRACEPARENT / DEFENSECLAW_TRACESTATE / the
#            OTEL_* equivalents from the agent's exported env. Returns
#            a curl -H argument array via stdout in line-buffered form
#            (one header per line) so callers can ingest it with
#            `mapfile -t TRACE_HEADER_ARGS < <(defenseclaw_extract_trace_context)`.
#          - defenseclaw_validate_traceparent: enforces the W3C format
#            (version-traceid-spanid-flags, 55 chars total, all hex)
#            before emitting the header so a hostile env value can't
#            forge an arbitrary string into the gateway's trace
#            context.
#        The Go side accepts the headers only on the two hook-bearing
#        routes (/api/v1/<connector>/hook, /api/v1/codex/notify) via
#        shouldExtractHookTrace, so an unscoped caller cannot splice
#        an arbitrary trace context into the gateway's trace tree.
#   v6 — refuses the stock macOS /usr/bin/python3 CLT launcher stub.
#        Adds _dc_python3_usable, which additionally verifies
#        `xcode-select -p` succeeds before trusting a python3 binary
#        under /usr/bin on Darwin, and switches both python3 call sites
#        (_dc_jq's fallback and defenseclaw_read_stdin_capped's tier 1)
#        to the new gate. Without the guard, QA on stock macOS hosts
#        (AVC + codex, no Xcode CLT) saw the "install command line
#        developer tools" GUI dialog pop on every hook invocation and
#        the subsequent codex hook then received an empty stdin payload,
#        posted a bad request to the gateway, and blocked the user's
#        prompt with a "codex hook error: gateway returned HTTP 400"
#        message. Internal-only helper; no hook-script signatures
#        changed and the schema marker stays at v6, so older gateways
#        that already wrote a v6 helper here (bare `command -v python3`
#        gate) still get the fix on next write via writeHookHelpers'
#        same-version bytes-different path.
#
# Sourced at the top of every hook in this directory (claude-code-hook.sh,
# codex-hook.sh, inspect-*.sh) BEFORE any agent-supplied data is touched.
# The Go side already strips dangerous git env (sanitizeHookCWD +
# safeGitEnv); this file gives the shell-side scripts the matching
# defense surface so a rogue agent can't influence the hook by exporting
# GIT_*, HOME, PATH, etc. before invoking it.

# _dc_python3_usable returns 0 when python3 is on PATH AND can be safely

# /usr/bin/python3 exists as a launcher stub that pops the "install
# command line developer tools" GUI dialog on first invocation and then
# exits non-zero without executing the script — a bare `command -v
# python3` check treats that stub as usable, and the resulting invocation
# both harasses the operator with an installer dialog and returns an
# empty body that fails the downstream hook (gateway sees a truncated
# payload, responds HTTP 400, hook fails closed and blocks the user's
# prompt). Skip the stub by verifying `xcode-select -p` succeeds when
# python3 resolves under /usr/bin on Darwin; if CLT is not installed,
# treat python3 as absent and fall through to the head(1) / string-only
# paths.
#
# `xcode-select -p` itself is safe to run without CLT: it is a macOS
# system binary (part of the base OS, not CLT) whose only side effect
# is to print the currently selected developer directory or exit 2. The
# GUI installer dialog is triggered by `xcode-select --install`, which
# this helper never invokes.

# When jq is absent the shim tries python3 (handles both string and
# object fields such as claude_code_output), then falls back to
# defenseclaw_json_string_field for string-only fields.  Object fields

# defenseclaw_read_stdin_capped reads stdin into a shell variable but
# refuses bodies larger than ${DEFENSECLAW_HOOK_MAX_BODY} (default 1MB).
# It writes the captured body to stdout so callers consume it via
# command substitution. On overflow it emits a transport-category log
# line, prints "" to stdout, and returns 1 — the hook should treat
# that as a fail-closed misconfiguration (a 1MB+ prompt is well
# outside any legitimate connector payload, and silently truncating
# JSON would yield a parse error downstream that's much harder to
# diagnose than a clear "body too large" error).
#
# Why `head -c` and not `dd`/`read`:
#   - `head -c N` is portable across coreutils + busybox, supported in
#     POSIX since 2024, and reads exactly N bytes then closes the pipe.
#   - It does NOT consume more than the cap+1 byte on the input fd,
#     so a hostile producer streaming 1GB of zeros gets cut off after
#     the first 1MB+1 — no OOM, no kernel pipe buffer abuse.
#   - The trailing "1 byte over" is detected by re-reading via
#     `head -c 1` from the same stdin; if anything remains we know
#     the cap was breached.
#
# Usage:
#   PAYLOAD="$(defenseclaw_read_stdin_capped)" || exit $?
#
# Returns 0 with the body on stdout. Returns 1 (overflow) with an
# empty stdout. If `head` is missing we read the body with a bounded
# python3 reader (overflow still returns 1); only when both head(1) and
# python3 are absent do we fall back to a legacy unbounded read so the
# hook still functions on minimal containers, logging it as a
