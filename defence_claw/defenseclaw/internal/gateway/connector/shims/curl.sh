# DefenseClaw shim for curl — inspects URL and flags before executing.
#
# Avarice F-2029 / chain F-3397: pre-fix this shim called the gateway's
# /api/v1/inspect/tool endpoint UNAUTHENTICATED. With a configured
# gateway token the sidecar returns 401 + {"error":"unauthorized"}; the
# shim's `jq -r '.action // "allow"'` then fell back to "allow" and
# exec'd the real curl. Combined with the inspect-request hook also
# being unauthenticated (F-2025), a malicious agent had a complete
# unauthenticated path past every inspection layer.
#
# Fix: load the gateway bearer token from .token (written next to the
# shim) or DEFENSECLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN, send Authorization on every
# inspection call, and treat HTTP 401/403 OR a {"error":...} response
# WITHOUT a recognized action field as a HARD BLOCK so a misconfigured
# auth path can never be silently downgraded to "allow".
