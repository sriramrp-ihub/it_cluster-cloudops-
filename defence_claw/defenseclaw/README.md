DefenseClaw combines a Python operator CLI, a Go gateway, connector hooks, policy,
scanners, and observability exporters. It is an enforcement and evidence layer;
it does not prove that an agent, model interaction, or third-party capability is
risk-free.

## Documentation

The [DefenseClaw documentation website](https://cisco-ai-defense.github.io/defenseclaw/docs/)
is the source of truth for installation, setup, configuration, commands, and
operator workflows:

## Source development

Source targets are contributor tooling. They are not an installation or upgrade
path for a release-managed host; use the website guides above for those tasks.
The checked-in toolchain contracts are Python `>=3.10,<3.14`
([`pyproject.toml`](pyproject.toml)) and Go `1.26.4`
([`go.mod`](go.mod)). CI exercises the TypeScript components with Node.js 24.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cisco-ai-defense/defenseclaw.git
cd defenseclaw
make build
make test
make check
make lint
```

`make build` produces checkout artifacts without publishing them or changing
managed installation state; its `pycli` step may create or update the shared
repository-local `.venv`. Run `make help` before using state-changing source
targets. All local source targets share that one locked, test-ready `.venv`;
there is no separate production-versus-development Python environment to
select. `make test`, `make check`, and `make py-lint` bootstrap that environment
when needed. `make all` intentionally rebuilds and activates the current
checkout for local development; the lower-level
`make install`, `make dev-install`, and `scripts/install-dev.sh` targets enforce
source-ownership rules and are not an upgrade path. Release-managed
installations use the release-owned `scripts/upgrade.sh` or
`scripts/upgrade.ps1` resolver described on the
[upgrade page](https://cisco-ai-defense.github.io/defenseclaw/docs/get-started/upgrade/).
