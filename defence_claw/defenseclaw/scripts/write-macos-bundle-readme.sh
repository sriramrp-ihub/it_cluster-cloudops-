# DefenseClaw macOS bundle ${VERSION} (${GOOS}/${GOARCH})

Self-contained installer for a managed_enterprise DefenseClaw
deployment on macOS. No repository checkout, Go toolchain, or Homebrew
formula is required at install time — everything the installer needs
ships in this folder.

## Install

\`\`\`
sudo ./install.sh --mode action --connector cursor,claudecode
\`\`\`

Full flag reference: \`./install.sh --help\`.

The installer resolves the gateway binary and plist by looking next to
\`install.sh\` first, so the bundle works verbatim from wherever you
place it.

### Custom plist overrides

Two paths are supported for the LaunchDaemon plist source:

- **Bundle default** (\`com.cisco.secureclient.defenseclaw.plist\` next to
  \`install.sh\`) — used automatically. The bundled plist inherits the
  extracting user's uid when you unpack the tarball; that's fine
  because its content came from this signed bundle.
- **Explicit override** via \`--plist <path>\` or the
  \`DEFENSECLAW_PLIST_SRC\` environment variable — treated as an
  untrusted operator input and required to be **root-owned** (\`chown
  root:wheel <path>\`) before install.sh will accept it.

Both paths refuse any source that is group- or world-writable (mode
must not include \`0022\`). Fix with:

\`\`\`
sudo chmod 0644 <path-to-plist>
\`\`\`

## Uninstall

Preserve config + audit DB (reversible reinstall):

\`\`\`
sudo ./uninstall.sh
\`\`\`

Full wipe (system files, runtime state, and DefenseClaw entries in the
user's native agent configs — non-DefenseClaw entries preserved):

\`\`\`
sudo ./uninstall.sh --purge -y
\`\`\`

## Requirements

- macOS with \`launchctl\` (base image; no Xcode Command Line Tools
  required for install, upgrade, or a standard uninstall — those
  paths are shell-only or delegate to the bundled DefenseClaw
  binary).
- Python 3 (\`/usr/bin/python3\`) is required ONLY when
  \`sudo ./uninstall.sh --purge\` runs against a host with the \`amp\`
  connector installed. The Amp scrubber
  (\`lib/scrub_agent_configs.py\`) restores the pre-install plugin
  from a signed backup and needs Python's stdlib crypto for
  SHA-256 verification. Other connectors (Codex / Claude Code /
  Cursor) scrub through the Go binary and do not need Python.
- Root privileges (\`sudo\`).
- Target user's home directory must not be group/other-writable
  (installer will refuse with an exact \`chmod\` fix).

Everything else — Codex / Claude Code / Cursor version detection, hook
config pre-creation, guardian invocation, tamper repair — is handled by
the scripts.
